# Case Study of Categorizing the Factors in women with PCOS

This project focuses on the factors that affect an ovarian condition in most women called PolyCystic Ovarian Syndrome. Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a health problem that affects women of childbearing age.

Women with PCOS may have infrequent or prolonged menstrual periods or excess male hormone (androgen) levels. The ovaries may develop numerous small collections of fluid (follicles) and fail to regularly release eggs. Women with PCOS have a hormonal imbalance and metabolism problems that may affect their overall health. PCOS manifests as a variety of symptoms.

The exact cause of PCOS is unknown. Early diagnosis and treatment and weight loss may reduce the risk of long-term complications such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease before they turn 40 yrs old.

PCOS affects 1-in-10 women:

10% women of child bearing age estimated to have PCOS
50% women go undiagnosed
4.3 Billion cost to the American healthcare system to diagnose and treat women with PCOS
The risk of women with PCOS developing endometrial cancer is increased by 3 times

Thus, in this project we will be focusing on different factors that affect the menstruation cycle, the infertility and the well-being of any woman based on the health and lifestyle. My goal is to use the PCOS dataset on a variety of statistical methods that can be implemented to extract necessary features and get accurate predictions
